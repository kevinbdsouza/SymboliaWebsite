    title: "Navigating Labor and Growth in the AI Decade: A Review and Research Agenda",
    date: 'June 2025',
    description: "AIâ€™s economic impact is both vast and highly uncertain. Current forecasts \
    swing from unprecedented prosperity to severe inequality, but most rely on narrow models that \
    ignore the feedback loops linking technology, policy, and society. In this writeup, we review recent research on automation \
    exposure, firm-level adoption, and accelerating capabilities, and find large knowledge gaps. \
    We propose a more realistic path forward that demands richer modeling, better data, interdisciplinary work, and \
    adaptive governance to channel AI toward broadly shared prosperity.",
