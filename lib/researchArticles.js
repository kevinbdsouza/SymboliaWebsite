    title: "Navigating Labor and Growth in the AI Decade: A Review and Research Agenda",
    date: 'June 2025',
    description: "AIâ€™s economic impact is both vast and highly uncertain. Current forecasts swing from unprecedented prosperity to severe inequality, but most rely on narrow models that ignore the feedback loops linking technology, policy, and society. In this writeup, we review recent research on automation exposure, firm-level adoption, and accelerating capabilities, and find large knowledge gaps. We propose a more realistic path forward that demands richer modeling, better data, interdisciplinary work, and adaptive governance to channel AI toward broadly shared prosperity.",
